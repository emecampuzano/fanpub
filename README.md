## Why FANPUB?

Wattpad is a great platform for aspiring authors and readers alike, but it has 3 popular issues: For starters, it has a limited reading interface where theming options are sparse, especially on desktop where there's no dark mode, Then reading is often interrupted by WAY too many ads (for which the revenue is not split with authors). And lastly, there's no support to read its stories on e-readers. 

Readers have dealt with these limitations in their own way, mostly taking screenshots of the stories to read them offline, or making pdfs. The problem with this is that pdfs are uncomfortable *af* to read and, of course, don't have a dark mode. FANPUB approaches it differently: it creates an EPUB that's ready to go in no time, and that means: with no comment counts and no awkward spacing.
